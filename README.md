# Terraform Module: Namecheap Domain with AWS Route 53 Hosted Zone

## Overview

This Terraform module manages a domain registered with Namecheap, using AWS Route 53 to create and manage DNS records. The module configures a hosted zone in AWS Route 53 and links the Namecheap domain's DNS settings to Route 53 for easy DNS management and automation.

## Features

- Creates an AWS Route 53 hosted zone for the domain.
- Configures DNS records, such as A, CNAME, MX, and TXT, based on input variables.
- Links Namecheap's DNS settings to the AWS Route 53 name servers.
- Supports both root domains and subdomains.
  
## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) v1.0 or higher
- AWS account with Route 53 permissions
- A domain registered on [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
- Namecheap API key and username for DNS management

## Usage

1. Add the module to your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
module "namecheap_domain" {
  source = "path-to-your-module"

  domain_name          = "example.com"
  subdomain_name       = "sub.example.com"        # Optional
  aws_profile          = "your-aws-profile"       # AWS CLI profile
  aws_region           = "us-east-1"              # AWS region
  namecheap_api_key    = "your-namecheap-api-key"
  namecheap_username   = "your-namecheap-username"
  route53_zone_id      = "Z1XXXXXXX"              # If you have an existing hosted zone
  enable_dns_records   = true                     # Enable DNS records in Route 53
}
```

2. Apply the Terraform configuration:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

3. Once applied, the module will:
   - Create or use the specified AWS Route 53 hosted zone.
   - Add DNS records to Route 53 based on the input configuration.
   - Output the AWS name servers required for Namecheap configuration.

4. Update the Namecheap domainâ€™s DNS settings:
   - Log in to your Namecheap account.
   - Navigate to the domain's DNS settings.
   - Update the name servers with the values provided in the module output.

## Inputs

| Name                  | Description                                                  | Type     | Default | Required |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|----------|
| `domain_name`          | The fully qualified domain name (e.g., `example.com`)         | `string` | n/a     | yes      |
| `route53_zone_id`      | Existing Route 53 hosted zone ID (optional)                  | `string` | `""`    | no       |

## Outputs

| Name               | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `route53_name_servers` | List of AWS Route 53 name servers to configure in Namecheap |
| `route53_zone_id`   | The Route 53 hosted zone ID for the domain       |


## Important Notes

- Ensure that your AWS account has the necessary permissions to manage Route 53 hosted zones and DNS records.
- Namecheap's API must be enabled for your account to use the API key.
- Name servers typically take 24 to 48 hours to propagate after updating them in Namecheap.
